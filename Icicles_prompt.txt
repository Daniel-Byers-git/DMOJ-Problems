As part of your mandatory forty hours of community service you have been tasked with getting rid of some rather unsightly 
icicles outside of Martingrove.

There are N icicles that you were tasked with destroying, with the ith icicle having a length of Li. 
When you destroy an icicle its length is set to 0 . After careful examination, you realize that the icicles can 
be spared for aesthetic reasons if they are symmetrical. That is, a sequence of N icicles is considered symmetrical if 
the ith icicle from the left has the same length as the ith icicle from the right.

What is the minimum number of icicles that you must destroy?
Constraints
1 ≤ N , Li ≤ 10^6

Input Specification
The first line contains integer N .

The second line contains N integers, where the i th integer represents the length of the ith icicle.

Output Specification
Output a single integer, the minimum number of icicles needed to be destroyed.

Sample Input:
5
3 2 1 4 3

Sample Output:
2
